### Initial planning
The planning consist of 7 sprints where every sprint is 1 week long. (I'm not using Scrum, but I just use the concept of sprints as parts of the project).  
The projects planning and tasks management is done with Github Issues and Github Projects. [This planning is also available here](https://github.com/samuelroland/galeriz/projects).
