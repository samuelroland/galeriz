# Work Diary

Note: there are no logs before the 14.02.2022 as I didn't have the CdC. I spent my time to train myself on Laravel, install a fresh Laravel app and my development environment.  
Note 2: all dates are in 2022.

| 28.02 | 3      | 4              | I worked on the migration and factories of images and GalleryUser. The galleries have a default cover if cover_id is null. Image files are stored in storage/app/public. I’ve added the missing foreign keys to the migrations. |                                                                              |
| 28.02 | 3      | 1              | I’ve generated the MLD by reverse engineering and ajusted the display, I've validated the result with the MCD.                                                                                                                  |                                                                              |
| 19.02 | 2      | 1              | I finished the models with register, login and galleries models.                                                                                                                                                                |                                                                              |
| 19.02 | 2      | 6              | I worked on the galleries page in BDD. I wrote 4 feature tests for the required content of my page. I wrote the basic HTML to have the image and title displayed. Then when my tests passed, I’ve designed the page.            | I’ve struggled a lot with the images display and tests.                      |
