# Work Diary

Note: there are no logs before the 14.02.2022 as I didn't have the CdC. I spent my time to train myself on Laravel, install a fresh Laravel app and my development environment.  
Note 2: all dates are in 2022.

| 28.02 | 3      | 4              | I worked on the migration and factories of images and GalleryUser. The galleries have a default cover if cover_id is null. Image files are stored in storage/app/public. I’ve added the missing foreign keys to the migrations.                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                       |
| 28.02 | 3      | 1              | I’ve generated the MLD by reverse engineering and ajusted the display, I've validated the result with the MCD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |                                                                                                                       |
| 28.02 | 3      | 1              | I finished the models with register, login and galleries models.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |                                                                                                                       |
| 28.02 | 3      | 6              | I worked on the galleries page in BDD. I wrote 4 feature tests for the required content of my page. I wrote the basic HTML to have the image and title displayed. Then when my tests passed, I’ve designed the page.                                                                                                             | I’ve struggled a lot with the images display and tests.                                                               |

| 10.03 | 4      | 3              | M. Hurni went for a short discussion. I've created a few new routes and added basic tests for them. The tests now runs in an in memory sqlite database. I've created an empty gallery details page. I've made some design on the layout for the $slot.                                                                           | I'm a bit late with my planification.

| 11.03 | 4      | 1              | I've fixed some routes settings. I've changed the logo.

| 11.03 | 4      | 5              | I've designed the Gallery details page, it contains everything, it's fully tested. I've tested and implemented a default not found image system if the path is invalid. I added the missing buttons in the dropdown menu. I've create the Create a gallery page.                                                                 | Working from home to catch up the time missed on Monday.

| 14.03 | 5      | 12             | I worked on the gallery creation pages to display the form, validate data, display errors and build a field blade component. I finished the My galleries pages with 3 tests.

| 21.03 | 6      | 12             | I worked at home. I created the section in the documentation, wrote a bunch of texts, and made the models for gallery edition.

I managed some tasks on this sprint on Github Projects. I fixed a few tests. I didnt' test the image upload because I lack time for the moment.                                                              |                                                                                                                       |

| 24.03 | 6      | 3              | I worked from home. I refactored the display of images list with a new Livewire component called `ImageGrid`. I finished to manage the image upload, I added a flashmessage for the action and an upload/uploaded state.                                                                                                         | There is no tests for this feature for the moment.                                                                    |
| 24.03 | 6      | 3              | I worked an additional time to finish image upload feature, as we are very near of the end of this project.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                       |

| 25.03 | 6      | 3              | I displayed a red square for a trash icon on the bottom left of images in the gallery for the deletion. I wrote 5 tests for image deletion (testing the backend as usual). I included the to set to null the cover image when this image is deleted.                                                                             |                                                                                                                       |
